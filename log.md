# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 30th 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Did the first project on Wes Bos' JS30 course. Also did some FreeCodeCamp JS course.

**Thoughts:** I'm really quite new to JS frontend, and understanding what is passed by default with eventlisteners, etc. is still something I need to get my head around. I could though, which is good. 
Also I never usually follow video tutorials. This guy's were good!

**Link to work:** Offline tutorial.
