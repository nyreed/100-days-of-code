# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 30th 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Did the first project on Wes Bos' JS30 course. Also did some FreeCodeCamp JS course.

**Thoughts:** I'm really quite new to JS frontend, and understanding what is passed by default with eventlisteners, etc. is still something I need to get my head around. I could though, which is good. 
Also I never usually follow video tutorials. This guy's were good!

**Link to work:** Offline tutorial.

### Day 2: December 4th 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some of the Advent of Code problems. Spent half the time wrestling with PyCharm. C'est la vie!

**Thoughts:** I still find this difficult, it's good to go back to basics!

### Day 3: December 10th 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Figured out day 3 of Advent of Code. 

**Thoughts:** I could not figure out where I was wrong for the life of me. By using TDD methods, I was able to work out where the problem was. Great!
These are taking me a while to do, but it's pretty fun!
Should go back to working on the website soon!
PS. I know 100 days of code should be about projects but I think this is fun too.
